## Description:

This repository has been created to showcase JavaScript's ability to generate interactive pages, demonstrated through the creation of a timed multiple choice quiz. Take the quiz and test your knowledge of Javascript fundamentals and save your score and initials to the list of highscores. You're on the clock so watch the time - but make sure not to rush; every wrong answer deducts 10 seconds from your time limit. Good luck!
